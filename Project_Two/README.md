# Project 2: Operationalizing Machine Learning
## By Connor Gag

## Overview
In this project, I learned how to deploy many of the parts of a machine learning pipeline in Azure ML. I learned how to create each of these parts by using the Azure UI as well as by using the python SDK. These steps include creating the AutoML, deploying it, and understanding and consuming the endpoint.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.
