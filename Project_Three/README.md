# General Health Predictions Based on Survey Data

*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.

This project predicts an individual's general health by using data that the individual provided. This survey was part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the dataset on Kaggle, "factors assessed by the BRFSS include tobacco use, health care coverage, HIV/AIDS knowledge or prevention,
physical activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Data are collected from a random sample of adults (one per
household) through a telephone survey." 

More information on the data can be found on Kagge at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system?datasetId=2192&sortBy=voteCount



## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remember to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
